          <p>We aim to reduce clutter to have a clear mind, focusing only on the essential items needed for our children.</p>
          <h3>Authenticity </h3>
          <p>Being your honest, true self is a path of self-exploration. There is no end-goal, itâ€™s all about the journey.</p>
          <h3>Inclusive </h3>
          <p>We celebrate our diversity as humans. No matter your gender, income level, or limitations, we are here to support you.</p>
          <h3>Inspirational</h3>
          <p>Parenthood is a rite of passage. We want to establish a community and platform where you can find resources, share struggles and celebrate your victories together.</p>
